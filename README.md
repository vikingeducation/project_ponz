# Ponz.io
Building Ponz.io, with its endearingly upside-down-triangle-shaped business model.

## Maddie Rajavasireddy

### Assignment Description:   
Once a user signs up with Ponz.io—a name derived from our original coupons idea—they will be presented with their referral link. Their friends can follow this link to a custom signup form. Once a friend signs up, the original user will be awarded 40 Ponz points. When their friend, in turn, signs up another Ponvert, the original user will receive 20 Ponz points. This pattern will continue down the pyram—err, down the chain of opportunity forever, with the amount of rewarded Ponz points decreasing in the following pattern:    
Ponzversion Distance --> Ponz points (1 --> 40, 2 --> 20, 3 --> 10, 4 --> 5, 5 --> 2, 6+ --> 1)
